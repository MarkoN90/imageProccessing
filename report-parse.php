Structure Complexity Simple Normal Complex Waste Calculation NOTE: This waste calculation table is for asphalt shingle roofing applications. All values in table below only include roof areas of 3/12 pitch or greater. For total measurements of all pitches, please refer to the Lengths, Areas, and Pitches section below.

The provided suggested waste factor is intended to serve as a guide—actual waste percentages may differ based upon several variables that EagleView does not control. These waste factor variables include, but are not limited to, individual installation techniques, crew experiences, asphalt shingle material subtleties, and potential salvage from the site. Individual results may vary from the suggested waste factor that EagleView has provided. The suggested waste is not to replace or substitute for experience or judgment as to any given replacement or repair work.
